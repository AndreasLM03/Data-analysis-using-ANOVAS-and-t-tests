# Data-analysis-using-ANOVAS-and-t-tests
Data analysis using ANOVAS and t tests. Here I would like to test a hypothesis of a data set from one of my studies at the TU-Darmstadt by means of inference-specific tests



The starting point is a data set that I collected in a study on  automated driving. For this I measured the cognitive workload in the form of a time task. For this I built a detection-response task based on Arduino Mircocontroller (source https://github.com/InstituteOfErgonomics/drtrc). As soon as a stimulus in the form of a light signal is emitted, a test participant has to react to it in the form of a button press. The reaction time between light signal on and reaction time of the button press is quantified. More detailed information can be found in my publish paper (DOI 10.1186/s12544-021-00475-5). In this study, data were recorded from 56 subjects in five different non-driving related tasks and one baseline.
